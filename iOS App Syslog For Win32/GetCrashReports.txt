This script was written for a QA team that needed to easily all crash dump information from a device.  This script allows the quality analyst to select the device they want to download the crash dumps of (either via network or USB cable) and initial the transfer.

This script relied on the libimobiledevice executables being in the same folder:
- idevice_id.exe
- idevicename.exe
- idevicecrashreport.exe

The advantage of this over executing idevicesyslog directly is that:
- It allows the user to easily select the device they want to get the crash dump info of.
- The information is placed into a folder where the device name & current date/time is apparent.
- The list of devices that we can connect to is displayed as device name instead of UDID.

Can be easily launched from included BAT file which is useful for some users.

Binaries for libimobiledevice can be found here:
