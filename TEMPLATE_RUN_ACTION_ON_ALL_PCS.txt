This simple script generates a list of computer names that have a sequentially incrementing number (E.G. WKS002, WKS003, etc.), work out which computers are contactable and then attempts to execute commands on them via a ScriptBlock.

It will dump three lists / TXT files:
- one that lists all computers that can be contacted
- one that lists all computers that can not be contacted.
- one that lists all computers where an execution error occured.

The current date & time will be appended to the name of the text files.

This script may depend on computers having an unrestricted execution policy.

script settings modified in first variables listed.
