### DESCRIPTION: 
This repo contains code for some of the various scripts and small application I've made throughout my career.

Some of these can be used in other environments but some of the bespoke scripts have served their purpose.  I hope by making this code available it provides value to someone again though.  In any case, the scripts serve as an example of the automation tasks I can perform.  I've tried to make the code readable and maintainable however I'm more than happy to hear feedback on better ways to handle tasks.

Each script has an associated text file with a description and instructions and sometimes a screenshot.
