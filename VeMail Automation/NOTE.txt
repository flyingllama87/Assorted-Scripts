I made these scripts whilst employed at vision6 (vision6.com.au) and supported their SaaS online marketing product VeMail.  I used these tools to help customers beyond the expected level for helpdesk staff.

Whilst these scripts are very unlikely to be functionally useful to current customers or people viewing this, they serve as an example of bespoke scripts I've provided to help people & companies.
