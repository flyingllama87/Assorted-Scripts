This simple script generates a list of computer names that have a sequentially incrementing number (E.G. WKS002, WKS003, etc.) and then tries to contact those machines.   It will dump three lists / TXT files:
- one that lists all computers
- one that lists all computers that can be contacted
- one that lists all computers that can not be contacted.

The current date & time will be appended to the name of the text files.

Script settings modified in first variables listed.
