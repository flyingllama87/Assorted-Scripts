Project: Confluence Page Management Project:
Purpose: Automating routine bulk page management operations
Tech used: C#, XML-RPC, Confluence, CMS, API

This script was to automate routine bulk page management operations on an Atlassian Confluence instance via its API.

The program was written in C#/VS Express and connects to Confluence instances via its XML-RPC API.  The script was executed bi-annually, when employees had their performance appraisals done.  Per employee, the script archives the existing performance management pages (PDP, Objectives & Bonuses) and creates new ones from templates with appropriate permissions.  The script would also create a copy only for the employee’s lead that has a special set of permissions.  The program had the ability to exclude certain wildcards / names of people where the standard performance management process did not apply and it also gave the executor a final confirmation of the performance management profiles the script would process so as to prevent mistakes.

Whilst this script is very unlikely to be functionally useful to people viewing this, it serves as an example of bespoke scripts I've provided to help companies.
